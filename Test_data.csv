cgn to fao cologne to faro on an a320. outbound flight a little late due to late arrival of aircraft. flight was on a jetway but passengers had to use the stairs. crew were nice and flight was full same on return flight from faro. i had a smart price ticket so you should sit in row 4 to 14 with more legroom onward flight i was seated row 15 return row 23. as miles and more member in my profile they knew that i needed a lactose free meal but you only get a snack box (cheese sandwich/roll or chicken/salami sandwich/roll) but both are not with butter/margarine they all contain cream cheese as basic spread so i was not able to eat that. when the crew came around i was entitled to only one soft drink you have to pay for wine or a beer. spirits not available at all. since both flights were full and only 3 crew members were on board it was a hard job for them. they have less toilets compared to the old lh planes so we had only 2 toilets for almost 150 passengers on the return flight one wc was not serviceable.,3.0,0
i flew from vienna to hamburg and return with germanwings because lufthansa doesn't fly there anymore and the austrian flight times didn't fit my plans. i was pleasantly surprised that germanwings already has the new lh and os seats. overall the journey was really good. the flights were on time the crew very friendly and funny and the catering was also very good! i think i would choose germanwings on further journeys!,10.0,1
went with germanwings from manchester to cologne 21st october returned 28th october first time with this airline very satisfied and would definitely recommend to friends flights on time and staff very helpful.,10.0,1
pmi to cgn. check in was open 2.5 hours before flight. staff talking to each other and not to passengers. they forgot to label one bag and we had to remind them. two umbrellas took ages to label for the flight and had to explain what to do. staff unable to put the bonus miles into systems and we were transferred to another desk. staff here useless and after 20 minutes they managed to enter the bonus number. now only one of us has miles while the other has no miles credited. flight left late and drinks and food were served for charge. we had a voucher so we got a sandwich and one soft drink for free. crew ok.,4.0,0
germanwings took over the service on dusseldorf - basel route from lufthansa. i am a business traveller and normally book my flights 2 weeks in advance. i flew with lufthansa for >1 year. since germanwings took over the average price of tickets has increased for me by +/- 50%. with lufthansa prices were between 180-300 euros with germanwings there are almost never,3.0,0
we (2 adults) flew from cgn to zhr in smart. the flight was surprisingly very good. much legroom in rows 1 to 10 nice and friendly flight attendants. the snack was quite okay. price was fine in future we will be flying germanwings if possible.,10.0,1
probably the best amongst the cheap flight carriers. most comfortable staff are good and when there is a problem they will actually try to resolve it. despite being a cheap airline they treat their passengers as people and not as cattle as is the norm with other similar airlines. just stay away from the german wings credit card! this is not run by german wings but an independent company. this is a real pain!,4.0,1
sxf-str-sxf. quite good for a budget airline with the usual negatives (boarding via bus and outdoor stairs in the freezing cold drinks and meals cost extra pretty tight seat pitch) but friendly and efficient service fairly new planes incredibly cheap airfares (we paid about 40 euros return from berlin to stuttgart) and both flights on time. nothing fancy but nothing too bad either.,4.0,0
dub-vce via cgn. the flight arrived about a 30mins late into dublin but managed to get to cologne just about on time. seats cabin amenities comfort all that you would expect for the price. we paid about $260 us for the three of us for the trip to venice. no complaints - you got what you paid for. only tricky thing was finding the transfer desk in cgn a small podium squirreled in between some shops adjoining the departure gates. coming from ireland we had to get new boarding passes for the second segment.,9.0,1
"i am senator on lufthansa so i fly a lot. flying germanwings smart fare (euro 18 for a sandwich), first drink is free but i was asked to pay euro 2.50 for the second drink (water). when i said i fly every week on this germanwings and its always free i was told by purser that now they have to charge due to a management crack down. germanwings is not a cheap airline on prices but is a very poor spin off from lufthansa. and they don't value passengers who fly a lot.",2.0,0
flight from cologne to santorini was very nice. the seats were comfortable with good pitch friendly crew clean plane and the buy on board sandwiches were tasty and reasonably priced.,9.0,1
"they have been unresponsive. we flew with germanwings (or tried to) on september 30th. after two lengthy delays passengers were notified that the flight was cancelled and to return to the check-in counter for further information. after waiting at the counter for another 30 minutes or so, staff began issuing refunds or providing alternate travel options to passengers. by this point it was quite late in the evening with limited options (plus we were 5+ hours after planned departure). we managed to get a voucher with 3 other passenger to get a flight from stuttgart to zurich with an ongoing connection to amsterdam (flights were with swiss). we made the flight and the connector (which was held back waiting for about 70 of us) however luggage did not make it. short of this is the airline was ill-prepared to manage this. they offered little information or options to passengers. since returning home i have been attempting to contact them via email and phone calls to discuss compensation per passenger rights brochure and they have been unresponsive. not a good way to run a business.",2.0,0
"no explanations, no offers of help. checked in at dusseldorf for our germanwings flight, and check in person asked whether we were a cancellation from yesterday. we said no, thinking it an odd question. twenty minutes into the flight an apparent technical fault meant we had to turn back. landed, but no bus to take us to the terminal for a good twenty minutes. informed once inside that the flight was cancelled. told to collect baggage and go to lufthansa desk in departures. the queue there was enormous, approximately 60 people in front of us, and thirty behind. waited for 3.5 hours in this queue. no explanations, no offers of help, no refreshments - nothing. got to front and options left were either take a taxi to cologne and flight to stansted the same evening, or stay over till the next day. we are sitting in cologne departures. the manchester flight has a one hour delay and the hamburg flight is cancelled. if we get out of here tonight it will be a miracle. partner has already driven three hours to heathrow, and now has a 300 mile round trip to collect us from stansted.",2.0,0
flight from vienna to cologne - vie-cgn - on the standard a319 airbus. using the smart price class (level) my wife and myself had comfortable seats and legroom for this trip of 1h10min. the snack box offered and its contents are just poor the only reason for paying the surcharge called smart price is preselected seating and one piece of checked in luggage. the general quality of service is acceptable - friendly crew efficient service clean planes plus the feeling of safety/security you buy in a plane of the lufthansa group. but do not forget: it is still a low cost flight - as a long time lufthansa frequent traveller i will never get accustomed to the fact that they try to charge Â£4.90 for a wine. no passenger bought any alcoholic beverage.,7.0,1
london stansted to stuttgart germany. return. more than satisfied with both legs of the flight. i expected an easyjet type arrangement but gw are definitely better. flight attendants were snarly though on outbound leg but it was only an hours trip. food on board should be avoided though.,8.0,1
dus-prg. best value for your $$ when it comes to short haul flights. short wait at check in staff at desk/flight crew were friendly helpful and outgoing seats had surprisingly more room than i expected and luggage was on the carousel quickly.,8.0,1
man-cgn on a319. punctual flight on a clean modern plane. extremely good value for the price paid. a decent bottle of beer on board at a reasonable price was a bonus. very satisfied. i also used the fly/rail add-on train fare which is a real bargain if you're travelling any distance at the german end of the journey.,9.0,1
cgn-lis booked long ago (05/2013) when their new fare scheme (smart best etc.) was not implemented yet thus i sat in seat 1f with generous legroom but got only a few points credited. but it was a good price and a generally acceptable standard as far as baggage allowance seat quality etc. is concerned. flight left a little late no apology or reason given but with good tailwinds we made an on time arrival. service on board was ok although the quality of their turkey salami sandwich is well below my standard it's just the fluffy british-american sandwich style not using the crispy rolls we like in germany. on such longer flights of more than two hours they should offer a pasta or a similar hot dish as their parent company does on similar routes. beverages were served as well - standard ones free of charge special ones or alcoholic drinks for a hefty price which is unacceptable to me (almost five euros for a small bottle of wine (187 ml) in a plastic glass). no newspapers or other entertainment. friendly and efficient service. i have to tell myself again and again: you get what you paid for - and that's what i did on this flight.,7.0,1
29th july 2013 flight 4u838 from cologne to bologna. flight was the second of two that day with the same airline. flight delayed 1 hour due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. staff kept the passengers informed in a polite and professional manner. boarding was orderly and sensibly managed. the cabin crew warmly welcomed the passengers. the flight had severe turbulence and the crew did little to allay the fears of passengers. the lady pilot made a few semi-audible announcements and did seemed to be focused on making up for the delay. disembarkation was chaotic as italian passengers pushed to exit the flight. the cabin crew did nothing to try and control what could have been a dangerous situation. the fare was not the cheapest of fares on offer and due to the abrupt manner of the cabin crew on this flight my experience of germanwings has been soured somewhat. i won't use germanwings on this route again.,4.0,0
on a recent trip from stuttgart to stansted i had the window seat in a row which was also occupied by a young mother and her four or five year old daughter. the minor took the seat next to me. once we had achieved cruising altitude the mother produced an ipad from her bag and placed it on the table in front of the child. then without the slightest consideration for their fellow passengers a mickey mouse movie was run with the soundtrack coming to all in earshot over the speakers. since it was a reasonably short flight i plugged my own headphones in a did my best to ignore the cartoon. now that such technology is available i think it might be high time for germanwings to regulate such behavior. obviously a sense of social responsibility is no longer sufficient. germanwings usually provides a decent service it would be a shame if they allow selfishly ignorant passengers to spoil it.,5.0,1
"i was refused some water. i am less than impressed with germanwings service to say the least. on my first connection to hamburg the stewardess has told us that we could have some water for free, while everything has to be charged. during my second connection from hamburg to london i was refused some water, despite being pregnant and not feeling well. i find this disgusting, the fact that a passenger will not be offered water if they're unwell, and will not be looked after in any way. needless to say the stewards would only be nice to the passengers who have also booked their on board meals or bought on board drinks.",3.0,0
regular on ham-bhx which is germanwings operated by eurowings bombardier crj 900 jets. flight has never been delayed by more than 20mins (>30 flights) and staff are friendly. i was able to get some very cheap tickets for this route so i cannot complain. my only gripe is the bus boarding and de-boarding at ham. flybe connects to an airbridge both at bhx and ham which is much preferable.,8.0,1
travelled from manchester to vienna with a 3 hour stop over in koln/bonn. first flight was good with an on time departure reasonably friendly cabin crew staff and a decent and comfortable journey. however from our stop in koln/bonn the trip deteriorated. we were segregated into a small area of the airport with very little to do see or even eat/shop. the second flight was 45 minutes late and had some of the most miserable cabin staff i have ever experienced. i wasn't even offer a drink to purchase. i would rate germanwings as very average and certainly not what i would expect from a german carrier.,4.0,0
booked lufthansa flight cologne-berlin on 28 jan. on 2 jan i got the information that the flight was operated by germanwings a german low-cost carrier. so was the flight. low cost: 1 hrs delayed for my beer i had to pay in euros - cash. lounge use was denied as the flight was operated under 4u code. no service for a high lufthansa price. not recommended very disappointed.,2.0,0
spu-dtm.30th may 2013. 08.20 departure. flight arrived in from cologne on time. upon boarding the return leg to dortmund the senior male cabin crew member stood at the forward door and did not acknowledge any of his passengers when we boarded. not a good morning or hello or even the slightest hint of a smile. after take off the racket of banging galley doors continued throughout the flight! the senior male cabin crew member commenced service from the front of the cabin by himself i was clearly travelling on my own astonishingly his inflight service statement was und sie (and you)! not what would i like to drink or would i like a cheese or ham sandwich? not even a smile and showing no enthusiasm! upon leaving the aircraft i didn't expect a goodbye and of course didn't receive one. poor customer service.,2.94,0
flew london heathrow - cologne bonn on monday 8th september. had checked in online and printed my boarding card 2 days before but as i had a suitcase to go in the hold i still needed to queue at the baggage drop-off point/check in desk. flight left on time and was smooth throughout. the plane seemed new and was clean. my fare included a snack (choice of cheese or ham roll) a small packet with 3 boiled sweets (not quite sure why) and a small bottle of water. i chose the cheese sandwich which was ok but could be better. after the complimentary snack service the crew came round offering hot and cold drinks - including alcoholic drinks - although not sure if any of these were complimentary. we landed 1 hour after departure from heathrow slightly less time than advertised. i have scored the in-flight entertainment a 1 purely because being a short flight there wasn't any and the website won't allow me to submit my review without a score. based on my experience i would consider flying with german wings again.,10.0,1
stn-haj: outward leg fine comfortable leather seats. return journey delayed by 1hr due to birds in engine took off 1.5hrs late however we were last to board plane and advised that all of the overhead luggage compartments were full. one of our bags was placed with the other main luggage. once the bag had been taken we realised our passports were in this bag and advised the crew. they told us that our bag would be given to us when we left the plane. upon further enquiry we found out that our hand luggage would turn up in baggage collection. so a wonderful arrival at stansted with no passports - kindly escorted to baggage collection to await hand luggage with passports - rather embarrassing. anyhow just a warning that crew don't seem to be aware. other than that a pleasant flight.,5.0,1
flew best class from hamburg to cologne. best is not business but it is a best germanwings has to offer. you sit in row 1 to 3 and the middle seat is free so there is maximum of 12 travellers. you have access to lh lounge which is full in hamburg airport. there is a choice of finger food salat nuts and gummibears as well as hot and cold drinks beer wine and spirits. boarding with priority. was a little surprised by the food you get on board you can choose from the germanwings card whatever you want for free if it is loaded. the best thing was the flight attendant who was nice and very friendly. she addressed everybody by name and was professional. at cologne it took ages again until baggage arrived so no priority for our bags. this was my first best-class with germanwings would fly them in this class again but i do prefer lh instead if it is possible.,9.0,1
hamburg to prague late monday morning. this segment was part of a larger lufthansa itinerary though clearly advertised as a 4u flight. the catch here is that germanwings out of hamburg is actually operated by eurowings crj900s which is an absolute letdown compared to the usual a320s. the staff are enthusiastic about offering refreshments though - unlike lufthansa proper - these are strictly for sale and are perhaps pushed too hard. there was nothing intrinsically wrong with the flight expect for the tight and cramped airplane these flights just don't measure up to the level of service across the lh network.,5.0,0
the last-minute addition of Â£13 for use of a credit card [it was a debit card] and some other fee with no prior notice at the very last stage of the booking procedure verges on sharp practice by german wings. the public are not fools. the sudden switch to german towards the end of booking must also be inconvenient for those who do not speak it. these reviews raise many points - do germanwings take note or act?,3.0,0
cgn-zrh. despite the sudden snowfall at their cologne hub germanwings managed to keep their operations moving reasonably efficiently. waiting pax were kept informed and when the delayed aircraft came in from leipzig it was turned around in less than 15 minutes. the aircraft seemed almost new and was less than half full. service pleasant of the low cost variety and snacks and drinks cost no more than they would in a cologne cafÃ©. germanwings has recently offered miles & more redemptions making it a potentially interesting partner.,6.0,1
we have just returned from cologne to manchester using germanwings - we were very impressed - we have frequently used other cheap airlines and if you want more pay more! you can check in on line 72 hours before travelling and can select seats free of charge. the only criticism is that you can't check in for return at the same time as you can with other airlines - that means unless you have access to a printer while away you are assigned seats at the airport for the return journey.,9.0,1
